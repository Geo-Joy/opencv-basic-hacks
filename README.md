## Binary Image Processing
1. Thresholding: used to create binary image from a grayscale image
2. Erosion: used to shrink the size of blobs (a group of connected pixels) in a binary image'
3. Dilation: used to expand the size of blobs in a binary image
4. Connected componenet analysis: used to label blob in a binary image.

### 1 - Thresholding
Thresholding is a simple operation that converts a grayscale image into a binary image based on the intensity of each pixels.
